        <div class="biography__body">
          <p>Born June 27th, 2000 as the youngest of his 3 siblings, Devin "Heinz" Heinzler adopted lots of his interests
            from his two older brothers and his sister. Living a typical suburban life growing up, he was drawn towards sports
            and the pursuit of a career through schooling. Although he had a busy schedule regarding his more "conventional" activities, 
            he was always intensely drawn to gaming. With the help of his two older brothers, he was introduced to a variety of games 
            and genres such as FPS games like Call of Duty, MMO's like RuneScape and World of Warcraft, 
            and many more. While he found most popular titles enjoyable and sunk plenty of time into them, 
            FPS games always seemed to catch his attention. By the age of 12, he was consistently holding the top ranked spot in the original
            Destiny multiplayer.
          </p>
          <p>While Heinz found success in other game types, like MMO's and solo games, the name "Kid Heinz" never pulled much weight outside
            of FPS games. When the not-so-popular AAA title "Titanfall 2" first dropped, he wasn't too interested. But after months
            of seeing clips of the game's ahead-of-its-time core mechanics, he had to give it a try. Fast-forward 2 years and several THOUSAND
            hours later, and Heinz had become one of the game's most reputable names, dominating the scene on both the public and competitive level.

          </p>
          <p>
            While the rush of competition kept his interest for a time, the repetitive and intense nature of the competitive side of gaming
            started to chip away at his resolve. Heinz's solution to avoid the dreaded "burn-out" phase of his favorite game was to take a step
            back from competing and focus more on entertaining. Once his name started flashing over viewer's directories on Twitch, 
            he was met with the passion and support that came with the Titanfall community. Finally, after years of building his brand
            and growing his audience, Kid Heinz found a hobby he could passionately sink his teeth into: content creation.

          <h2 class="section-title">Content</h2>
        </header>
        <p>What's he doing now, you might ask? While content creation stretched Heinz's interest for
          Titanfall 2 and its community, it didn't last forever. After a staggering 9,400 hours in the game,
           Heinz decided it was time to move on. But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree. In this case, the tree 
           is Titanfall 2, and the apple is Apex Legends. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Set in the same universe with similar content to its 
           predecessor, Apex was an easy transition for Heinz. He felt right at home and, with the highly saturated 
           competitive and entertainment market, Heinz had plenty of opponents to prove his worth against. Since the 
           switch, Heinz has been taking some time off streaming and content creation in general to make sure his 
           skills are ready to be shown, holding himself to a higher skill-standard than others might. Additionally, 
           the milestone-oriented gamer is devoting a considerable amount of time to learning software engineering.
           He plans to hopefully one day combine his coding knowledge with his knowledge of the gaming industry, like
